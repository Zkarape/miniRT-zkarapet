## About miniRT

**miniRT** is a project from [42 School](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) where you create a basic ray tracer â€” a program that generates images by simulating the way light interacts with objects.  
The project is an introduction to computer graphics, 3D rendering, and math concepts like vectors, normals, and ray-object intersections.

### Core Goals:
- Parse a simple scene description file
- Render spheres, planes, and cylinders with basic lighting
- Manage ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
- Handle shadows and camera perspectives

### Features to Implement:
- **Ray casting**: Shoot rays from the camera into the scene and compute what they hit.
- **Object intersection**: Find the closest object hit by a ray.
- **Lighting calculation**: Use the Phong reflection model (ambient + diffuse + specular).
- **Simple parsing**: Read scene parameters from a file.
- **Memory management**: Handle leaks and errors properly.

## Useful Resources:
- **Math basics**: Vector algebra, dot product, cross product
- **Rendering concepts**: Ray tracing, shading models
- **C programming skills**: Pointer management, clean code, debugging
- **Graphics library**: MiniLibX (for creating windows and displaying pixels)

## Final Notes

This project teaches **discipline, mathematical thinking, and clean coding practices**.  
Even after you finish it, there's a lot of room to improve â€” adding textures, reflections, refractions, anti-aliasing, and more advanced rendering techniques.
